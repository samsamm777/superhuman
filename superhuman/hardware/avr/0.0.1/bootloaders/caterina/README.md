# A-Star 32U4 Bootloader

This directory contains the source code and compiled files for the A-Star 32U4 Bootloader,
which is included with the Pololu 32U4 family of boards.

We have tested the bootloader and confirmed that it works with
Microsoft Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, XP (with Service Pack 3),
Linux, and macOS 10.11.
It should also work with later versions of macOS.

For documentation of the bootloader, see the "The A-Star 32U4 Bootloader"
section in the [Pololu A-Star 32U4 User's Guide][guide].

For information about how we compiled the bootloader,
see Caterina-A-Star.txt in this directory.
